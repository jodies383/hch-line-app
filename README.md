# safem
SAFEM was created to help people in the Western Cape find Healthcare Facilities in areas less affected by COVID-19. Our aim is to assist people over 60, those with cormorbidities and anyone else vulnerable to COVID-19. In the future we plan on expanding our app to not only Healthcare Facilities but tourism and travelling in the Western Cape as a whole.
