# safem
SAFEM was created to help people in the Western Cape find healthcare facilities in areas less affected by COVID-19. Our aim is to assist people over 60, those with cormorbidities and anyone else vulnerable to COVID-19 stay as safe as possible while travelling to clinics or hospitals. In the future we plan on expanding our app to not only healthcare facilities but tourism and travelling in the Western Cape as a whole.
