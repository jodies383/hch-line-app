                <li>The productive number stands at approximately 1.4 which means that the number of the infections
                    is accelerating rapidly.</li>
                <li>The proportion of Covid-19 tests which are positive has also increased to an average of 16.2</li>

            <p>Hospital beds in the Western Cape are filling up rapidly because of Covid-19 patients.
                <br>Beds are running out fast in Cape Metro hospitals with ICUs in particular
                overflowing with Covid-19 and trauma patients.
                However some patients are not able to get a bed once they have been
                admitted and have to be assisted while sitting in chairs.

            <p>Ever since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic our hospitals have been dealing with long queues.<br>
                Without an appointment people have to spend most of their day waiting to be helped.
                Pregnant, diabetic and old people are at an even higher risk of getting infected, therefore it is not
                safe for
                them to stand in these long queues.</p>
